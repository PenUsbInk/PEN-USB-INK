                Aiming to raise crucial questions for design thinking, it consists in a set of 3 issues that together confront the reader with the impact that physical and digital formats have on how people assimilate information.
                This issue, PEN, addresses the topic News, and how both medias have problems that need to be overcome by complementing each other. The print publication aims to make a visual analogy with the digital universe.The website not only follows, but also completes it, creating an untapped union.

                    <h2>The crisis in local journalism has become a crisis of democracy</h2>
                </a>
                <div class="text">The crisis in journalism has turned into a crisis of democracy. In concrete terms, what does that really mean? <br><br>
                    First, the reporter shortage means residents don’t have the information to make decisions for
                    their families or hold institutions accountable. They don’t know if their schools are
                    underperforming or their mayor is corrupt or their courts are fair.<br><br>
                    Residents walk into the voting booth carrying only small shards of information about the local
                    candidates. That is, if they bother to vote. Several studies have shown that voting turnout
                    declines as reporting does.<br><br>
                    The paucity of reporters has triggered an invisible power shift toward elected officials. A Pew
                    Research Center study of Baltimore showed an increase in local stories based on press releases
                    from elected officials.<br><br>
                    The trends in journalism exacerbate the divide between the coasts and the rest of the country.
                    In 2014, almost 1 out of 5 U.S. reporters worked in New York, Washington or Los Angeles,
                    compared with 1 in 8 in 2004. Isn’t it likely that this contributed to the media missing the two
                    biggest stories of the past few years – the rise of the opioid epidemic in middle America and
                    the political strength of Donald Trump?<br><br>
                    In addition, with less local reporting, residents come to understand each other less well. Fellow
                    citizens become caricatures rather than neighbors — and we become more polarized. People
                    rely more on national sources, which tend to be ideologically driven. By contrast, local issues
                    — Why are there so many traffic deaths at Maple and Main? How do our teacher salaries
                    compare with those in the rest of the state? — often cross party boundaries.<br><br>
                    Finally, the lack of reporters helps erode trust in journalism. Residents would be less likely to
                    view “the media” as arrogant, ideologically driven miscreants if they see real reporters at
                    school board meetings until midnight, covering nitty-gritty stories of importance to them.</div>

            <div class="text">I don’t actually think it makes sense to equate data visualisations with fake news, however it’s crucial to begin this essay with a consideration of how the two are caught up in the same historical winds. But how do they diverge? <br><br>
                Like art, fake news tends to stay within the audience bubbles of people whose beliefs would be reinforced by the artefact, whereas visualisations break out more widely by virtue of their propensity to circulate.<br><br> They are often attractive and surprising, with a punch line that demands a small amount of diagrammatic literacy; they are part of the lingua franca of the internet, appropriate to the context of digital networks, mobile devices, and variable attention spans; and, most importantly, they are not overtly authored. <br><br>A certain trust in the machine has presided over the early history of internet data visualisations, allowing them a claim on truth and objectivity. They are readily deployed in news, law, government, activism, science, and finance – all impregnated by the internet in different ways – to communicate, to generate publicity, to make arguments, to influence opinion, or simply to understand complex phenomena.</div><br>

            </a>
            <div class="text">For every step that computational systems take in mastering a new field of practice, from understanding natural speech to composing music, humanity also takes a step to close the gap. <br><br><br> We shape ourselves around the cultural reality of code, shoring up the facade of computation where it falls short and working feverishly to extend it, to complete the edifice of the ubiquitous algorithm. Some of these choices are simple, even pedantic, like adjusting our speech patterns to (we hope) make our statements easier for machines to understand. <br><br>Others are far more subtle, like the temptation to organize one’s weekend for optimal selfie opportunities, or the hidden biases encoded in nominally objective code.<br><br> We depend on computational systems for a growing share of the raw material of intellectual life, from books and news stories to the very basics, like vocabulary, ideas to share, and people to share them with. <br><br>The more we invest ourselves in these culture machines, the further we proceed down a path of collaboration. More than collaboration: a kind of co-identity. We are coming to define who we are through digital practice because virtual spaces are becoming more real to us than visceral ones.</div><br>

                <h2>Correct website and social media errors</h2>
            </a>
            <div class="text">One elemental concept of transparency, which is a conceptual shift for some organizations, is that corrections are a good thing.<br><br>
                Errors are of course unfortunate and bad. We must make as much an effort as possible to prevent errors before they make their way into the world. The ease with which mistaken claims and false facts can pick up speed and spread requires that we be diligent in verifying facts before publication. News organizations should track the error rates of individual reporters, and offer training and, when necessary, discipline to help ensure overall quality.<br><br>
                However, some amount of errors will inevitably occur, especially in a fast paced digital environment. That’s why we correct our errors — and do so publicly and transparently.<br><br>
                Rather than destroying trust, corrections are a powerful tool to reinforce how accountable and transparent we are.
                “If you’re willing to admit you’re wrong, people will trust you more,” said Mathew Ingram of Gigaom. “If I said to someone ‘You know, I’m never wrong’ they would think I was a psychopath or a liar, so they would trust me less. That’s versus if I said ‘I screw up all the time.’ They trust you more because you’re more human.”
                That’s the paradox of trust: admitting our mistakes and failings make us more deserving of trust.

New research has again shown that content on paper affects our brains in different and more powerful ways. <br><br>The latest findings come from Temple University consumer neuroscience researchers. In a study conducted for the U.S. Post Office, they found significant differences in the way our brains process the two ad formats.<br><br>

            <h3>Why do people treat this dichotomy as a refusal of coexistence?</h3><br>
            <div class="text">Given the list of problems above referred, it is easy to see that both the physical and digital media fail, in part, in their mission to convey the information among the society.
                Moreover, we can see that where one fails, the other is able to get around those difficulties and weaknesses. <br><br>
                However, each of these media has its value and its way of winning readers’ attention.
                Therefore, it is then that we question the fact that this dichotomy is almost always posed as a confrontation and an opposition.<br><br>
                Although we already accept to live in a physical world where digital is cohabiting more and more, unity, teamwork and collaboration between the two media are rarely explored these days, and design projects where that emphasize this union are difficult to find.<br><br>
                This issue reflects about how each medium has the potential to improve the other, and together can build a better understanding of the news they transmit.<br><br>
                If it is crucial for the reader to be informed about the world that surrounds him. It is extremely important that society in general trust what they read in the newspaper, or online, and it seems that it’s of the most interest that people keep looking for information, that they keep interested in being updated.<br><br> We need to prevent the troubles and put together the best of both worlds.
                Why not bring both media together to create something more reliable and interesting?
                The potential of this association is very high, and that is what PEN wants to explore.
